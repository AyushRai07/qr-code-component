### Continued Development

This was one of my first Frontend Mentor challenges, and I plan to continue improving by working on more projects that enhance my skills in:

- Responsive web design using HTML & CSS

- Layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid

- Writing clean and accessible markup

- Improving component-based thinking for reusable design patterns

- JavaScript interactivity in future challenges

My next focus will be on intermediate challenges that involve layout structuring and minor interactivity using JavaScript.
